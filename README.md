# CRIM (2016)
An Undergraduate **Capstone Project** Presented to the Faculty of School of Science and Technology in Centro Escolar University.

**CRIM** stands for Clinicians Reservation and Information Management System for the Dentistry Department of CEU Makati


## What is CRIM?
The Dentistry Department of CEU Makati offers dental check-ups and procedures to outsiders. The clinicians do treatments for their own patients as their way of practicing their profession. The Dentistry program in CEU is one of the best programs that is usually topping the dental examinations all over the Philippines.

Since The dentistry students of Centro Escolar University Legazpi Village is still using a manual way of recording their patient’s information and still does not have a more systematic way of handling the patient’s record. The Dentistry department commissioned the developers to create the system for them. The system helps maintain information about patients; This system is secure and only accessible by the user and the administrator. The system will provide a more organized record. The system will also be able to generate reservations for the dental clinicians.

## Significance of the Study
This study aimed to provide a more systematic way of providing reservations and storing dental patients information. 

The system will save all the dental patients information in a database for a more secure storage of records. The system can only be accessed by the administrator and user. The system will also provide a report which will be entitled Oral Diagnosis Report. Where all of the treatments and procedures will be present.

This project will also benefit the dental clinicians for they will no longer be using a pen and paper style of recording their patients’ information.

## Project Objectives
The main objective of the project was to develop the CRIM: Web-Based Clinicians Reservation and Information Management System for the Dentistry Department of CEU Makati.
1. Facilitate reservations for the dental clinicians.
2. Provide a more secured storage of dental records.
3. Replace the pen and paper system of dental health information storage.

## Tools and Technologies used

### Front End
The development of the front end was made possible with the use of web technologies such as **JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, JQUERY, DataTables** and **BOOTSTRAP** for the design of the front end.

### Back End
The development of the back end was made possible with the use of **Java** and **MySQL**. The proponent used Java as programming language for developing the system, **j2ee** and **j2se** in **Eclipse IDE** for the back end. **MySQL** databases are queried using a subset of the standard **Structured Query Language (SQL)**. Java can be used to create complete applications that may run on a single computer or be distributed among servers and clients in a network. It can also be used to build a small application module or applet for use as part of a webpage.
